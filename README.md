Where to find instagra id ? Actually you should not ( in the future ) , right now however, we have not made that process automatic yet. And you will need to have business/creator instagram account. 

you need:
facebook --> create a facebook page ---> then you should link facebook to your instagram account
then 
facebook business manager -- settings ---business assets -- isntagram account id
